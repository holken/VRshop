In unity:
1. Make shop in 3D - (done shelf and wall mesh)
-Create a product mesh
-add texture to product mesh
-make mesh for kassa
-make texture for kassa
-DIVIDE UP MY CURRENT MESHES AND ADD MATERIALS ON DIFFERENT PARTS INSTEAD
optional:
-make flower mesh and texture
-make real door

5. Extra easter eggs

6. Make display that shows how much the total cost --Done 3D text that shows on cart and updates from cost (ugly display, only a box, have to be changed and maybe add more stuff? Got a usable 3D shader now at least too for 3D text)
--6.1. Make a nicer display
--6.2. Add more details etc? Change size? Quality of life etc.

7. Eventually, add some sort of thing for payment? -- FKING DONE/future improvement?
-add a real kassa
-hold over something and press + stay in trigger area?


quick fix to price of product (take sqrt of x and y to get the distance that will work from all view angels)(<2min fix)

extra stuff:
1. Make the products stay in the cart by making them stuck in the cart
2. Do some fancy optimization algorithm for the cart to fit more?
3. A machine or something you can place products in to show more descriptions? Or Augmented reality thingy when you pick up?
make products spin a bit in AR mode


PHP:
to be continued

Design:
2. Check old report from design and make plan how to fit in the interaction design into the whole project



Done stuff:

1. Do 3D stuff
-add texture to shelf
