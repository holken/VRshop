5. Extra easter eggs
6. Make display that shows how much the total cost --Done 3D text that shows on cart and updates from cost (ugly display, only a box, have to be changed and maybe add more stuff? Got a usable 3D shader now at least too for 3D text)

extra stuff:
1. Make the products stay in the cart by making them stuck in the cart
2. Do some fancy optimization algorithm for the cart to fit more?
