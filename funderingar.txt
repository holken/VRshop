mass upload

1. Upload all meshes for themself even the cardboards, add script to add components, put them in
neg: Can't change the components outside of runtime (can change them if we add parameters to the script though!)
might not be that simple since we need to create the meshes outside of unity?
pro: Might be simple who knows

2. Upload only textures and decor an already made prefab (or more) and change parameters to fit new product
neg: might not be that simple?
pro: We don't have to create the meshes outside of unity, can just upload the textures to unity/done meshes and add parameters
